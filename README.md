# Pure Python Time Series read & write
This simple script enables easy reading of Time Series data from .csv into python ordered dictionary and writing it back to .csv format.
The solution is ideal when implementing python scripts on low-budget shared web-servers where instalation of pandas and numpy modules is not possible.
Ordered Dictionary is one of few ways (not counting pandas) to read and write data time series data without loosing the chronological order.
The script can be useful for manipulation of time series data with a timestamp or indexed one-column data in general.
